# Laboratory 2

## Exercise 1
Generate a random number between 25 and 150 and create an array of that size. Fill the array with random integers between -100 and 100. Calculate the average value of all elements and count how many elements are above and below this average.

## Exercise 2
Write a program that reads two integers a and b from the keyboard, where a is less than b. The program should find all palindromic numbers between a and b, inclusive. A palindromic number reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 1331). Display all the palindromic numbers found and their count.

## Exercise 3
Write a program that takes an integer n as input and calculates the factorial of n using recursion. Additionally, implement a non-recursive solution and compare the execution time of both approaches for various values of n.

## Exercise 4
Implement an application that allows the user to filter and sort a list of student records. First, the user is asked to input student records in the format "name,age,grade" on separate lines (e.g., "John,19,85"). After entering all records, the user can filter students by minimum grade threshold and sort the results by name, age, or grade in ascending or descending order.

## Exercise 5
Write a program that reads a list of strings from the user, on one line, separated by semicolons. The program should then analyze the strings and display: the longest string, the shortest string, the string with the most vowels, and the string with the most consonants. If there are ties, display all strings that tie for each category.

## Exercise 6
Create a number guessing game where the computer thinks of a 4-digit number with no repeated digits. The player tries to guess the number, and after each guess, the computer tells the player how many digits are correct and in the right position (bulls) and how many digits are correct but in the wrong position (cows). The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly. Display the number of attempts needed to win the game.
